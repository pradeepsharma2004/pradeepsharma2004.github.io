                                        Sometimes, to become successful and get closer to the person you can become, you don’t need to add more things — you need to give some of them up.<br><br>

                                        There are certain things that are universal, which will make you successful if you give up on them, even though each one of us could have a different definition of success.<br><br>

                                        You can give up on some of them as soon as today, while it might take a bit longer to give up on others.
